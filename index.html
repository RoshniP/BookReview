        <!--Quote of Benyamin-->
        <caption>Thought of Benyamin:</caption>
       <em> <q>You know how it is when you arrive in a new place and feel like you don’t belong there? That hesitation to recon with a new geography. That knowledge that this place is not mine, these ways of talking are not mine, these silences are not mine, this etiquette is not mine.So many new things to absorb.</q> ~ Benyamin, Jasmine Days</em></p>

<!--what would b expected-->
<h3>What to expect from this book?</h3>
<P><em>Benyamin's Jasmine Days</em> is a book that will appeal to serious readers. What it sometimes lacks in pace is more than made up by its beautiful story and setting.

    Since the book is set in the backdrop of the Arab Spring of 2011, it can essentially be called a socio-political drama. Expect a lot of family drama and some great perspectives coming straight out of those who are sometimes caught in the whirlwind of a revolution that they never asked for.</P>
<br><h3>About the author</h3>
<P>The author writes using his pen name, <a href="C:\Users\Roshni\Desktop\Story\ben.html">Benyamin</a>. He is an Indian author from Kerala who writes in Malayalam.

    His first book, Aadujeevatham (later translated as Goat Days) was published in 2008. Since then he has written 20 books and his books have been translated into multiple languages. He has also won the Kerala Sahitya Academy award.
    
    Born in 1971, he later shifted to Bahrain in search of employment. Two years after the Arab Spring revolution of 2011, he shifted back to Kerala and currently lives there.</P>
    <!--Story part-->
    <br><h3>Storyline</h3>
    <P><q>Jasmine Days</q> by <i>Benyamin</i> tells us the story of a young Pakistani girl, Sameera Parvin who migrates to an unknown city in the Middle East. The city remains unknown throughout the book and is referred to as just that – The City.

        Sameera shifts there because her Baba already lives there along with many of his relatives. These relatives of hers have been there for years and have made the city their home.
        
        Sameera soon takes up a job as a radio jockey. Just as she is getting successful at building a life for herself in the city, and getting comfortable with people around her, there comes the Arab Spring of 2011, a revolution that will change everything around her.
        
        Slowly, Sameera finds that everything that she ever dreamt of about her life in this world, will soon turn to dust. The winds of revolution will change the very face of the city, and the future of the people who live in it.
        
        This is the story of Sameera, her friends, relatives, colleagues, all of whose lives are caught in a revolution that they never asked for.</P>

    <!--Characters -->
    <h3>About the characters</h3>  
    <P>
        What I love about the characters of this book is how they come from such different backgrounds and have so many stories to tell.

Each of them, because of who they are and where they come from, offers a unique perspective. They are Indians and Pakistanis and Arabs, Shias and Sunnis, the rich and the poor, the natives and the migrants, the ruler and the ruled, Hindus and Muslims – all of them contributing something to the rich tapestry of the novel.

    <!--Why favorite-->
    <h3>What I absolutely loved?</h3>
    <P>I like this article ,since it is written in simple language.So it is easy to understand.I also love the way he confuses the reader about how much of the book is fact and how much of it is fiction? This style of writing is called <a href="https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literary-movements/realism/authors">Flaubertian Realism</a> and is used by many authors from time to time.</P>
       
    <P>   Reading Jasmine Days was like a lesson in history itself because I got to know so much about the Arab Spring of 2011. What I also got was a general idea of the modern-day Middle East. </P>
